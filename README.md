## Inspiration
We all wanted to use web-scraping to do something helpful. Our project is aimed at everyone that wants recommendations for movies. It is updated frequently, web scraping has been used so it will be automatically updated as soon as those websites are updated, and it can be sorted by IMDb ratings, which are one of the best indicators for movies.

## What it does
Allows the user to download a CSV file that has the top 1000 movies of all time. This makes it easy for people to prepare what they will watch next time they sit for a movie. This is very beneficial considering the vast options available, very few of which are enjoyable.

## How we built it
We used web scraping in Python to be able to create a program that can web scrape and then create a CSV file. It then opens the user interface, which we created out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that the user can look at 10 of our favorite picks and also download the CSV file onto their computer.

## Challenges we ran into
We were initially planning to have a page on our website which would display the top 50 items from the list of movies according to the user's specifications. However, time constraints meant that we had to leave this idea and instead have a constant 10 movies on the page and a download button for the rest.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Having finished a fully functioning project which can be used. It wasn't our initial idea but we did switch ideas in the middle of the hack so finishing was a big accomplishment for us.

## What we learned
- Time management is key, never leave things to the last minute.
- We learned how to web scrape. None of us had a lot of experience with it.

## What's next for Movie Night Dilemma
- We can have a sorting category on our website so that the user can decide genre, release date, age ratings, etc.
- We can also display the table on the website itself, 50 rows at a time.
